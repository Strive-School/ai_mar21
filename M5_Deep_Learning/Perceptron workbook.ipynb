    "We have seen the Perceptron algorithm, that is an algorithm to build a binary classifier for linearly separable data. We succesfully tested it on an example movies dataset, and unsuccesfully for the XOR problem, that contains not-linearly separable data. \n",

    "We learned that the Perceptron is for an artificial neural network what a neuron is for a biological one. We defined the sigmoid, a smooth and differentiable activation function that is often used in neural networks (you will meet cooler activation functions by the way!).\n",
